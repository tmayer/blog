The <a href="http://guitar.th-mayer.de/fretboard/" target="_blank">Guitar Fretboard Explorer</a> 
helps you to navigate through the standard tuning guitar fretboard. By hovering
over the strings on particular frets you see all similar natural notes together
with their corresponding notes in the score. In addition, the explorer also highlights certain
patterns on the fretboard to help memorize the relative note positions.
